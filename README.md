### Installation

If you want to use it, (and not bother with code), use this command:

```
cargo install rusterizer
```

If you don't have cargo, you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/Dhravya/readme-generator/releases)
This isn't recommended, because it won't be registered as a binary and you'll have to run the exe file

For contributing:

```
git clone https://github.com/Dhravya/readme-generator.git
cd Readme Generator
cargo install
```

### Usage
windows:
```
readme-generator.exe
```
Linux:
```
#give it permission to run
chmod +x readme-generator
#run it
readme-generator

```
Mac:

coming soon

Then all you have to do is fill a form!

Normally, you'd run `cargo run` but that isn't needed because i've published to crates.io
you can run `cargo build` to build the project for your os with rust compiler(You must have the source files)
